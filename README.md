## Search algorithms
* Linear Search

## Sorting algorithms
* Bubble Sort
  The simples sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It starts at the beginning of an unsorted array and 'bubbles up' unsorted values towards the end, until the array is completely sorted.<br />
  &plus; Simple to implement <br />
  &minus; Multiple iterations, Quadratic time complexity (O(n^2))
